# g-mail-relayer

This project intends to build a Java mail relayer. The need comes due to some limitations found in my projects. For sure, there are projects there who can perform this kind of actions, but found none exactly matching and I felt like building it myself.

The goal is to build:
 + A Spring Boot REST application able to relay emails coming from another application, asynchronously, so the sender can forget about waiting to say EHLO!
 + It should include a vanilla SMTP server to cover legacy code that cannot for any reason (ie, money: come on guys, for things like this IT should get more budget) be adapted to the REST API


Thanks to [@avthart]( https://github.com/avthart ) and his [spring-boot-james-smtp-server]( https://github.com/avthart/spring-boot-james-smtp-server ) project as it enlightened me.
